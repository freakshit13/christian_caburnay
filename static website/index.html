       <p>“	
        In order to soothe the spirits of those it killed, and to make sure it claims no further victims, <br> will swing my blade down and lop off the head of any demon without mercy! But I will not belittle <br>those who regret their actions and suffer over the things they did as demons. Because demons were once human. Because they were like me.	”

      <h1>Demon Slayer Anime</h1>
      <p>There are probably some of you out there who are into Japanese anime. Well I recently started watching the Japanese anime called,<br> “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba”. It is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotōge, and it is about Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy who becomes a demon slayer after his family is slaughtered and his younger sister Nezuko is turned into a demon. <br>I wasn’t sure what the hype was all about until I started watching the anime with my 8-year-old son, who actually started watching the anime way before me.</p>
